Cognitive Radios are devices capable of listening to the environment and select available frequencies for data transmission. The channel choice depends on its availability. The radio makes a query to a server, which returns the channels that are available on that location. Different signal propagation models are implemented on the server, for the available channels calculation. This work aims to develop a Web server showing the spectrum in the State of Rio de Janeiro, implement a note propagation model that considers the relief, guarantee the previous data calculation and allow a better user interaction with the server.
